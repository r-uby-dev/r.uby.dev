##
# Falcon service definition for r.uby.dev.
#
# Run with `bundle exec falcon host` (or `service rubydev reload`), which
# starts an async-service Controller that:
#
#   * binds a single shared listener in the parent process,
#   * forks N worker processes that all accept on that shared listener, and
#   * on SIGHUP performs a blue-green restart: it forks fresh workers, waits
#     for them to become ready, then gracefully drains the old ones.
#
# Each worker loads the app fresh from config.ru, so a SIGHUP picks up newly
# deployed code without dropping any in-flight requests.
#
# NOTE: Do not enable `preload` here. Preloading loads the application into
# the parent process, which would make new workers inherit *stale* in-memory
# code on reload. We deliberately keep the parent thin and let each worker
# boot the app from disk.
